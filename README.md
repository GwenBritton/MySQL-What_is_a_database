# Collaborating on Codio content
All of Codio's content is now in the public domain. We also encourage you to create content from scratch and place it in the public domain. This means ...

1. You can create your own derivative tutorial using Codio content as your starting point. You are free to do whatever you like with it from then on. 
2. Collaborate on this project with others. This is how all great open source software works and Codio, with the help of GitHub, gives you all the capabilities to do this.
3. You can create your own content from scratch and collaborate with others in the same way.
