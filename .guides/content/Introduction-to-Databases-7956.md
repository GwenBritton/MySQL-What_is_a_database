## What is a database?

A database is an organized collection of stored data that can be queried and modified. For example Facebook profile information is stored in a database, and when a profile is viewed in the browser, Facebook queries the database to get and then display the data. The profile can also be modified or even completely deleted. All the operations on the database are done using a special langauage called SQL.

## What is SQL

_SQL_, often pronounced _SEQUEL_ stands for Structured Query Language and is a _special-purpose programming language_ for manipulating data in a _relational database management system_. With the language you can define the structure of data and how to Create, Read, Update and Delete data. Data is stored as rows in tables for example a __profiles__ table will store all user profiles each on their own row. Rows can be related to data in rows in other tables for example individual profiles can appear in mutliple friend lists. 

### Relational databases

_Relational database management systems_ or RDBMS for short, are a common choice for the __storage of information__ used for:

- Financial records
- Manufacturing and logistical information
- Personnel data
- Other applications since the 1980s

_Relational databases_ are based on the __relational model__, in short it allows us to join related data in interesting ways.
