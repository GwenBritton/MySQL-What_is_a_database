### The MySQL command line interface tools

The terminal window is equipped with _MySQL_.

_MySQL_ is an open source implementation of a _relational database management system_ which contains the database server and client command line application that let us run SQL commands directly on the command line interface.

### MySQL server and client?

The MySQL server is used to __persist the data__ (store the data) and provide a query interface for it (SQL).

The MySQL client's purpose is to __allow you to use that query interface__ with SQL commands.

As a summary, you can use the MySQL client to send commands to any MySQL server in any part of the world from a remote computer if you have the access information, such as:

- The database name
- The hostname where the database is hosted. (Databases in your local computer use _localhost_ for example.)
- The database user
- The database password
