### The MySQL command line interface tools

The terminal window is equipped with _MySQL_.

_MySQL_ is an open source implementation of a _relational database management system_ which contains the database server and client command line application that let us run SQL commands directly on the command line interface.

Use the MySQL client by executing the following command in the terminal window:

```
mysql
```

Are you seeing __this prompt__ as well?: 

```
Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
...

mysql> 
```

From the client, SQL commands allow us to (among other things):

- Define where and how data is stored (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, rename)
- Manipulate the data (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Control the access to the data (GRANT, REVOKE)
