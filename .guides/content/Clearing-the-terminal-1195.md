### The terminal content has reached the bottom?
Whenever you need to clear your terminal inside a `mysql>` interactive screen or a default terminal prompt `codio ~/workspace $`, __execute the `ctrl + l` keys combination__ to get the prompt to the top most part of the screen. 

### Clearing the prompt only
The `mysql>` prompt as well as the default terminal prompt `codio ~/workspace $` can be cleared by pressing the `ctrl + u` keys combination.
